A cross-platform weather app coded with Xamarin.Forms (C#).

Displays information about the weather from a customisable set of locations.
Allows customisation via user preferences.

**IMPORTANT**: For the app to work, you need to edit the AppKey.cs file within the shared project, and replace the placeholder value with a valid api key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
